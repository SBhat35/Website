        Before anything else, a quick note on my name. I usually introduce myself as 'Sachit, like Watch-it', so most people know me as that. My correct birth-name is actually pronounced a bit differently: 
        the 'a' is pronounced like a 'uh' and the 't' is pronounced like 'th' (S-uh-chith). It's not entirely intuitive, but follows the same pattern as many other East Asian/Indian names. I have been recently been going by Sach (pronounced like 'Such').

The purpose of the this site is to simply consolidate pieces of life I enjoy and create a springboard for future ideas and experiences. I like to try new things, and built this site to exist as my home base.

I have interests spanning industries, companies and concepts. I am a sucker for B2C/B digital startups, asymmetric risk, early-stage venture capital, and systems-thinking. I currently work as a software engineer in <a className={styles.aboutLink} href="https://https://www.deloittedigital.com/" target="_blank">Deloitte's Digital studio</a>, though continue to push myself to view everything through the eyes of a product manager (including my own life). 

In the past, I've worked as an engineer at <a className={styles.aboutLink} href="https://opennetworking.org/" target="_blank">ON.Lab</a>, a software networking consortium continuing to disrupt traditional network infrastructure. More recently, I was a fellow in the <a className={styles.aboutLink} href="https://vimeo.com/295238898" target="_blank">True Ventures Entrepreneurship Corps</a>, where I was paired with <a className={styles.aboutLink} href="https://https://www.airship.com/" target="_blank">Airship</a> to help with product engineering and analytics. I graduated from <a className={styles.aboutLink} href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/" target="_blank">Vanderbilt University</a> in 2019, where I studied computer science and economics.

Outside of tech, I thoroughly enjoy reading, writing, walking, board games, HIIT, and self-tracking. I challenged myself to write a <a className={styles.aboutLink} href="http://newsletter.sachitbhat.com/" target="_blank">newsletter</a> for a year during quarantine, both to track my own progress but also incentive curiosity and learning. More recently, I created a <a className={styles.aboutLink} href="https://coda.io/@sachit-bhat/sb" target="_blank">page</a> to store articles and podcasts as well as a quick blurb of my thoughts. I crave spice, and have addiction to Cholula, eggs, and avocado (I have a cholula bottle graveyard and eat 3 eggs a day). My recent focus has been web development and prototyping. I used
Next.js to build this site and am continuing to experiment with <a className={styles.aboutLink} href="https://nextjs.org/Next" target="_blank">Next</a> and React.
